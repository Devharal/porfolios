description:  A Machine learning approach in fluid Mechanics for finding Velocity Field and Pressure field. This project helps to understand that how machine learning is expanding in each domain of science. In this project via ideas of Deep learning that is artificial neural network (ANN) how we can predict different flow patterns of fluid.
