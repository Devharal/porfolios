description:  Designed and implemented class-conditional image generation models tailored for alphanumeric and animal datasets within a 24-hour hackathon. These models were trained on proprietary data and deployed on a Django web server environment. Through user input prompts, the system generates corresponding images, showcasing a seamless integration of deep learning and web development technologies (Django, Python)
