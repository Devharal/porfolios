# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a third-year Mechanical Engineering B.Tech student at IIT Mandi, with a burning passion for the exciting and ever-evolving field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I believe that my background in Mechanical Engineering gives me a unique perspective and an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving, which, when combined with my passion for Deep Learning and NLP, opens up a world of possibilities for me. I am excited to embark on this journey of growth and development, and I'm looking forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
