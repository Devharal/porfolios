# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a recent B.Tech graduate in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Data Science from IIT Mandi. My burning passion for the exciting and ever-evolving fields of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, combined with my engineering background, gives me a unique interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving. This blend of skills opens up a world of possibilities for me. I am excited to embark on this journey of growth and development, eagerly looking forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
