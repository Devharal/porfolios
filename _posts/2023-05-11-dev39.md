description: In this seminar, we examine the details of how transformers work, and dive deep into the different kinds of transformers and how they're applied in different fields. We do this through a combination of instructor lectures, guest lectures, and classroom discussions. We will invite people at the forefront of transformers research across different domains for guest lectures.
